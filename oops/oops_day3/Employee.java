/*
 * Create a BLC class Employee class with properties 

private String firstName
private String lastName
private int employeeId
private double salary
private int noOfProject


Create a setEmployeeData() method with 5 parameters to initialize all the instance variables.

Implement calculateSalary() method that will add extra ammount in salary based on NoOfProject by using following criteria.

NoOfProject is more than 5 and less that 10 then add 5000.
NoOfProject is more than 10 and less that 20 then add 10000.
NoOfProject is more than 20 then add 15000. 	

 Take a method called displayDetails() to display the salary.
